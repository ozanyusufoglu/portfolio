Hi :) 
  
I‚Äôm a **Front-end Engineer** with a focus on the **React** ecosystem.

I have a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and used to work as an **R&D Manager**, where I coordinated multiple software projects across various domains. Following the pandemic, I decided to shift my career toward a more creative realm in software, focusing on building products that are more human- and society-oriented. I'm particularly interested in data visualization, digital cartography, history, and politics.

Right now, I'm developing **Monkeymind** üêµ, an AI-based productivity tool designed to help users establish a framework for attention and goal management in daily life. I use **React**, <TbBrandNextjs className='inline'/> **Next.js**, and <TbBrandFirebase className='inline'/> **Firebase** as my primary stack and love building complex components from scratch.

I enjoy working with like-minded people with **multidisciplinary** backgrounds. If you're interested in my skills and interests, let me know!
