# About me

Hey! My name is Ozan, nice to meet youðŸ¤ž

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Web Developer with Electrical & Electronics Engineering background. 

I formerly worked as an R&D Manager and coordinated multiple projects supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), the national partner of EU Horizon 2020 Programme. 

While I wasn't actively coding with this hat, I led the development team to build user-centered products that tackled critical problems in diverse domains, by utilizing R&D methodologies.
