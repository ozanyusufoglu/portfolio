# Information

Information processing theories in psychology describe how individuals perceive, encode, store, and retrieve information. These theories often consider factors such as the amount of information presented, its complexity, and its relevance to the task at hand. Information theory, developed by Claude Shannon, provides a mathematical framework for quantifying information content.
