Hi, nice to meet you :) 

I‚Äôm a **Fullstack Developer** with a focus on frontend, particularly React ecosystem. I have a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and used to work as an **R&D Manager**, where I coordinated multiple software projects aimed at solving critical problems across various domains. 

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve found that user interaction and information design are the most exciting aspects of software development.
After a post-pandemic pause to work, I decided to shift my career toward becoming an indie developer, focusing on frontend and UX to build more **human** oriented products. I am currently building **Monkeymind** üêµ, an AI based productivity tool helping users to build a solid framework of time and goal management.
I  use  <FaReact className='inline' color= 'darkcyan'/> **React**, <TbBrandNextjs className='inline' color='red'/> **Nextjs**  and <TbBrandFirebase className='inline' color='orange'/> **Firebase** as my primary stack and love building complex components from scratch. 

I enjoy working with like-minded people, particularly in a multidisciplinary context. I'm into data visualization, digital cartography, history, and politics.

I'm open for part-time and full-time positions, so let me know!
