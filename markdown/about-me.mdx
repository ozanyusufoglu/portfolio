Hi, nice to meet you :)

I‚Äôm a **Full-stack Developer** with a focus on **Front-end** particularly **React** ecosystem. 

I have a background in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and used to work as an **R&D Manager**, where I coordinated multiple software projects across various domains.
Following the pandemic, I decided to shift my career towards a more creative realm, becoming an indie developer to build more **human** and **society**-oriented products.

I am currently building **Monkeymind** üêµ, an AI-based productivity tool helping users to build a solid framework of time and goal management.
I use <FaReact className='inline'/> **React**, <TbBrandNextjs className='inline'/> **Next.js**, and <TbBrandFirebase className='inline'/> **Firebase** as my primary stack and love building complex components from scratch.

I'm into data visualization, digital cartography, history, and politics. I enjoy working with like-minded people with multidisciplinary backgrounds. Let me know, if you're interested in my skills and interests!
